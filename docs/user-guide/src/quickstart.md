# Quick Workflow

Follow these steps after your experiment to create an ELN archive you can import into eLabFTW or other ELN tools.

1. Launch the app (`cargo run` or open your packaged binary).
2. **Write your notes** in the [Markdown editor](markdown.md).
3. **Add files** in the [Attachments list](attachments.md): raw data, images, scripts. Rename in-place if needed; the app will sanitize names for the archive.
4. **Set date and time** in the [Date & Time Picker](datetime.md). Use the original experiment time.
5. **[Metadata](metadata.md)** and **[Keywords](keywords.md)**: add search terms and any instrument/sample fields you want to carry into your ELN.
6. Click **Save ELN archive**, choose a destination folder. If the button is
   disabled, see [Saving ELN Archives](saving.md) for the required fields.
7. You now have an ELN archive on disk. Everything above works fully offline; import it later into your ELN (e.g., eLabFTW) once you are back online or transferred the ELN archive to a computer with an internet connection.
